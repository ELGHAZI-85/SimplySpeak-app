# SimplySpeak-app : Audio-ChatGPT-to-Quiz-Form

The objective of this project is to automate the quiz creation process by harnessing the capabilities of the ChatGPT API. Additionally, we aim to convert the quizzes generated by ChatGPT into Google Forms using its API.

To initiate this workflow, we provide an interface that allows you to record audio, which will then be transcribed into text using the free Google Speech-to-Text API.
